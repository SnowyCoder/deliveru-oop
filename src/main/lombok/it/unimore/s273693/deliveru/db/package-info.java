/**
 * Contains all of the data-related code.

 * <p>
 * This is where in a real-world application the DB-interfacing code would be put, in this simple program everything is
 * stored on-file and since no real database is used the JavaFX declarative constructs are used.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The package is divided in two logical groups: The delivery and it's storage, and the User and it's storage,
 * those classes are similar to each other but they serve different purposes (as you can guess from their naming).
 * </p>
 * The user's password management has been deferred to the package {@link it.unimore.s273693.deliveru.password}.
